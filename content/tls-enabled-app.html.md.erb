This topic discusses developing an app under TLS for use with VMware GemFire for TAS.

Apps that connect to a TLS-enabled <%=vars.product_full%> service instance
must set properties to configure the communication with
the cluster components within the <%=vars.product_short%> service instance.

Ensure that the cluster-level prerequisite step of
[Preparing for TLS](prepare-TLS.html) has been completed.

For a Spring Data GemFire app
with a Spring Data GemFire library dependency of
2.2.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT or a more recent version,
attach the `@EnableSsl` annotation to your configuration class
to enable the TLS encryption for all cluster components.
Also set these properties:

```
ssl-use-default-context=true
ssl-endpoint-identification-enabled=false
```

For other apps, the properties should be

```
ssl-enabled-components=all
ssl-use-default-context=true
ssl-endpoint-identification-enabled=false
```

An app may set these properties with the `ClientCacheFactory.set()` method,
prior to creating a `ClientCache` instance.

The build and `cf push` of the app does not require any changes
to work with a TLS-enabled <%=vars.product_short%> service instance.
