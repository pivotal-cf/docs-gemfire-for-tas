This topic describes establishing mutually trusted TLS certificates for use with VMware GemFire for TAS.

In order for services instances in two foundations to communicate using TLS encryption, the CredHub
“/services/tls_ca” certificate must be trusted in both foundations; otherwise, WAN connections with
TLS will fail.

## <a id="wan-bi-tls-assumptions"></a> Assumptions

- You have two VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs) foundations, A and B, with a network connection between them.
- You wish to establish a TLS-encrypted WAN connection between a service instance on Foundation A and a service instance on Foundation B.
- The [Preparing for TLS](prepare-TLS.html) procedure has been followed for each foundation, establishing a CredHub “/services/tls_ca” certificate for each.

## <a id="establish-mutual-trust"></a> Establish Mutual Trust

In order for services instances in two foundations to communicate with TLS, the CredHub
“/services/tls_ca” certificate must be trusted in both foundations; otherwise, WAN connections
requiring TLS will fail.

To be trusted in both foundations, their certificates must be signed by:

- a single CA that is identical in both foundations, or
- two CAs, one in each foundation, which is trusted by the other foundation.

If one of these conditions is satisfied, mutually trusted credentials are already in place; there is no need to implement the following procedure.

If the two foundations have different “/services/tls_ca” certificates that are not already mutually trusted,
follow these steps to establish mutual trust.

Assuming you have two different TAS for VMs foundations, A and B, connected by a WAN:

1. Access the CredHub of Foundation A using instructions from [Access BOSH CredHub](rotating-ca.html#credhub)

2. Fetch the certificate from Foundation A using CredHub:

    ```
    credhub get -n /services/tls_ca -k certificate
    ```

3. Record the output.

4. Navigate to the **Ops Manager Installation Dashboard** of **Foundation B** and click the **BOSH Director** tile.

5. Click **Security**.

6. Append the contents of the new CA certificate to the old CA certificate under **Trusted Certificates**. Do not remove the old CA certificate.

7. Click **Save**.

8. Distribute the new CA certificate to your VMware GemFire for Tanzu Application Service VMs and regenerate each server certificate using the new CA:
   - Navigate back to the **Installation Dashboard**.
   - Click **Review Pending Changes**.
   - Click **ERRANDS**.
   - Select **Upgrade All Service Instances**.

9. Return to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager and click **Apply Changes**.


Repeat Steps 2 - 9 for Foundation B to put its services CA into Foundation A.
