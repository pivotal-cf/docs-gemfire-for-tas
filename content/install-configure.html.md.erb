### <a id="azs"></a> Assign Availability Zones and Networks

To select AZs and networks for VMs used by <%=vars.product_short%>, do the following:

1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks**.

1. Configure the fields on the **Assign AZs and Networks** pane as follows:

    <table>
        <tr><th>Field</th><th>Instructions</th></tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Place singleton jobs in</strong></td>
            <td>Select the region that you want for singleton VMs.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Balance other jobs in</strong></td>
            <td>Select the AZs that you want to use for distributing other cluster VMs.
            VMware recommends that you select all of them.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Network</strong></td>
            <td>Select your Tanzu Application Service (TAS) network.</td>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Service Network</strong></td>
            <td>Select the network to be used for cluster VMs.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

1. Click **Save**.

### <a id="smoke-test"></a> Smoke Test Plan Settings

The smoke-tests errand that runs after tile installation.
The errand verifies that your installation was successful.
By default, the `smoke-test` errand runs on the `system` org and the `p-cloudcache-smoke-test` space.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Smoke tests will fail unless you enable global default application security groups (ASGs). You can enable global default ASGs by binding the ASG to the <code>system</code> org without specifying a space. To enable global default ASGs, use <code>cf bind-running-security-group</code>.</p>

To select which plan to use for smoke tests, do the following:

1. Select a plan to use when the `smoke-tests` errand runs.

2. Ensure that the selected plan is enabled and configured.
For information about configuring plans, see [Configure Service Plans](#plan-config) below.
If the selected plan is not enabled, the `smoke-tests` errand fails.

VMware recommends that you use the smallest four-server plan for smoke tests.
Because smoke tests create and later destroy this plan, using a very small plan reduces installation time.

![Configuring Smoke Tests Plan](./images/select-smoke-test-plan.png)

### <a id="outbound-internet-access"></a>Allow Outbound Internet Access Settings

By default, outbound internet access is not allowed from service instances. 

If BOSH is configured to use an external blob store, you must allow outbound internet access from service instances.
Log forwarding and backups, which require external endpoints, might also require internet access.

To allow outbound internet access from service instance, do the following:

1. Select **Allow outbound internet access from service instances (IaaS-dependent)**.

![Outbound Internet Access](./images/allow-outbound-access.png)

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Outbound network traffic rules also depend on your IaaS settings. 
Consult your network or IaaS administrator to ensure that your IaaS allows outbound traffic to the external networks that your require.</p>

### <a id="default-distributed-system-id"></a>Default Distributed System ID Settings

Every service instance has an integer identifier called a **distributed system ID**.
The ID defaults to the value `0`.
Service instances that form a distributed system that communicate
across a WAN must have distinct IDs.
Those distinct ID values are set when creating the service instance.

To change the default distributed system ID value, do the following:

1. Replace the default value of `0` with your new default value.
Acceptable values are integers greater than or equal to `0` and
less than or equal to `255`.

![Default Distributed System ID setting](./images/dist-sys-ID-default.png)

### <a id="sharable-instances"></a>Sharable Instances Settings

To enable service-instance sharing for a <%=vars.product_short%>
service instance, do the following:

1. Set **Shareable Instances** to `Yes`.

![Configure shareable instances](./images/configure-shareable-instances.png)

For more information about service-instance sharing, see [Service-Instance Sharing](dev-instance-sharing.html)

### <a id="enable-service-gateway-creation"></a>Enable Creation of a Service Gateway Setting

The service gateway permits apps running outside the services foundation
(TAS) to communicate with the <%=vars.product_short%> service instance.
See [The App's Location](architecture.html#AppLocation) in _VMware Tanzu GemFire Architecture_
for an introduction to the service gateway.

1. If the communication between apps and the 
<%=vars.product_short%> service instance require a service gateway,
select the **Yes** radio button in the **Enable Service Gateway** setting.
This permits the instantiation of the service gateway when
a service instance is created and specifies a service gateway.

2. Enter a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) for the
**FQDN for TCP Router** field.
This was the FQDN that you used when you enabled TCP routing.
You can also find the in the output of the `cf domains` command.
From the output, select the `name` field  with type `tcp`.

3. Set the **Ingress Port for TCP Router** field with an unused port
that you noted when you enabled TCP routing.
Alternatively, to find the range of ports from which to choose,
in **Ops Manager** click **Tanzu Application Service**, then select **Networking**.
The range of ports from which to choose is near the bottom of the page
in a field named **TCP routing ports** under the heading **TCP routing**.

    ![Enable Service Gateway setting](./images/enable-services-gateway.png)

4. Click **Save**.

### <a id="configure-tags"></a> Configure Platform Tags

Platform tags are key-value pairs that are assigned to all service instance VM instances at the
IaaS level.
You can use these tags to organize and categorize your service instances. The accepted format
for these key-value pairs depends on the underlying Cloud Provider. For example, Google Cloud
Platform does not allow uppercase characters.

To use platform tags:

1. In the **Tags** text box, enter a comma-separated list of key-value pairs.

    ![Set Tags](./images/tags.png)

2. Click **Save**.

### <a id="configure-service-plans"></a> Configure Service Plans

You will configure 11 individual plans by selecting each of the tabs.
There are **Plan 1** through **Plan 5**,
three plans that reside on a single VM (called **Co-located Single VM Plan**),
and three plans that spread locators and servers among three VMs
(called **Co-located Multi VM Plan**).

![Configuring a Plan](./images/configure-plan.png)

* The **Plan Enabled** option is selected by default. If you do not want to add this plan to the CF service catalog, select **Plan Disabled**. You must enable at least one plan.

* The **Plan Name** text field allows you to customize the name of the plan. This plan name is displayed to developers when they view the service in the Marketplace.

* The **Plan Description** text field allows you to supply a plan description. The description is displayed to developers when they view the service in the Marketplace.

* The **Enable metrics for service instances** checkbox enables metrics for service instances created using the plan.
Once enabled, the metrics are sent to the Loggregator Firehose.

* The **CF Service Access** drop-down menu gives you the option to display or hide the service plan in the Marketplace.
    * **Enable Service Access** displays the service plan the Marketplace.
    * **Disable Service Access** makes the plan unavailable in the Marketplace. If you choose this option, you cannot make the plan available at a later time.
    * **Leave Service Access Unchanged** makes the plan unavailable in the Marketplace by default, but allows you to make it available at a later time.

* The **Maximum service instances** field sets the maximum number of <%=vars.product_short%> clusters that can exist simultaneously.

* When developers create or update a service instance, they can specify the number of servers in the cluster. The **Maximum servers per cluster** field allows operators to set an upper bound on the number of servers developers can request. If developers do not explicitly specify the number of servers in a service instance, a new cluster has the number of servers specified in the **Default Number of Servers** field.

* The **Availability zones for service instances** setting determines which AZs are used for a particular cluster. The members of a cluster are distributed evenly across AZs.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> After you select AZs for your service network, you cannot add additional AZs. Adding additional AZs causes existing service instances to lose data on update.</p>

The remaining fields control the VM type and persistent disk type for servers and locators. The total size of the cache is directly related to the number of servers and the amount of memory of the selected server VM type. VMware recommends the following configuration:

* For the **VM type for the Locator VMs** field, select a VM that has at least 2 CPUs, 1&nbsp;GB of RAM and 4&nbsp;GB of disk space.
* For the **Persistent disk type for the Locator VMs** field, select 10&nbsp;GB or higher.
* For the **VM type for the Server VMs** field, select a VM that has at least 2 CPUs, 4&nbsp;GB of RAM and 8&nbsp;GB of disk space.
* For the **Persistent disk type for the server VMs** field, select 10 GB or higher.

For more information about VM memory allocation, see [VM Memory Allocation](memory-allocation.html).

When you finish configuring the plan, click **Save** to save your configuration options.

### <a id="configure-co-located-multi-vm-plan"></a> Configure a Co-located Multi VM Plan

Any of the Co-located Multi VM Plans use three VMs to implement a default
plan with three locators and three servers.
Each of the three VMs has one locator and one server.
**Co-located Multi VM Plan 1** has a default plan name of `small-footprint`. 

This type of plan is appropriate for production installations that can tolerate the
diminished load-handling capacity and reduced resilience that would
result from the loss of a VM.
Installations needing resilience in the face of a VM loss
should use a plan in which each <%=vars.product_short%> cluster member resides within
its own VM.

You can create a <%=vars.product_short%> service instance using a Co-located Multi VM Plan with
more servers than the default three servers.
Follow the instructions in [Create or Delete a Service Instance](create-instance.html) to increase
the number of servers.

Scale up an existing service instance by increasing the number of servers,
as specified in 
[Updating a <%=vars.product_full%> Service Instance](update-instance.html).

Whether creating a new service instance or updating an existing service
instance to have more servers,
each additional server will be within its own VM.

Scaling down the quantity of servers within an existing service instance
is accomplished one server at a time to ensure redundancy is 
correctly maintained.
To scale down, use the `cf update-service` command as described in
[Updating a <%=vars.product_full%> Service Instance](update-instance.html)
to specify one server fewer than the total quantity of servers currently
running.

An error message will be issued if you attempt to scale down
by more than one server at a time,
or if you attempt to reduce the number of servers below the
minimum size of the default Co-located Multi VM Plan size of three servers.

To configure a Co-located Multi VM Plan,
enable the plan with the Co-located Multi VM Plan tab.

![Configuring a Co-located Multi VM Plan](./images/configure-sf-plan.png)

### <a id="configure-co-located-single-vm-plan"></a> Configure a Co-located Single VM Plan

A Co-located Single VM Plan is a type of service plan.
The plan provides a single locator and server,
which are colocated within a single VM. 

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Data loss results when the single VM that this plan provides powers down or restarts.</p>

The plan automatically creates a single region named
`example_partition_region`.
The region type is `PARTITION`, a partitioned region without
redundancy or persistence of entries.
You can create other regions as necessary with a Co-located Single VM Plan service instance.

There are three Co-located Single VM Plans to configure.
The page for configuring this plan is similar to the page for configuring 
other service plans.
To configure a Co-located Single VM Plan, input information in the fields and make selections from the options on each **Configure Co-located Single VM Plan** page. 

![Co-located Single VM Plan Configuration Sections](./images/dev-plan.png)

### <a id="syslog"></a>Syslog

By default, syslog forwarding is not enabled in <%=vars.product_short%>.
However, <%=vars.product_short%> supports forwarding syslog to an external log management service, for example, to Papertrail, Splunk, or your custom enterprise log sink.
Use the broker logs for debugging problems creating, updating, and binding service instances.

To enable remote syslog for the service broker, do the following:

1. Click **Syslog**.
   ![Configuring Log Management Service](./images/syslog-config.png)
2. Configure the fields on the **Syslog** pane as follows:

    <table>
        <tr><th>Field</th><th>Instructions</th></tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Do you want to configure Syslog for VMware Tanzu GemFire?</strong></td>
            <td>Select <code>Yes</code> to enable.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Address</strong></td>
            <td>Enter the address or host of the syslog server for sending logs, for example, <code>logs.example.com</code>.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Port</strong></td>
            <td>Enter the port of the syslog server for sending logs, for example, <code> 29279</code>.</td></tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Transport Protocol</strong></td>
            <td>Select <code>TCP</code>, <code>UDP</code>, or <code>RELP</code>.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Send service instance logs to external</strong></td>
            <td>By default, only the broker logs are forwarded to your configured log management
            service.
            To forward server and locator logs from all service instances, select this option.
            This lets you monitor the health of the clusters, but generates a large volume of logs
            files.<br><br>
            If you do not enable this option, only the broker logs which include information about
            service instance creation are forwarded, without logs about on-going cluster
            health.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Enable TLS</strong></td>
            <td>Select to enable secure log transmission through TLS. Without this, remote syslog
            sends unencrypted logs. VMware recommends that you enable TLS, as most syslog endpoints
            such as Papertrail and Logsearch require TLS.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Permitted Peer</strong></td>
            <td>This option is required if TLS is enabled. If several peer servers can respond to
            remote syslog connections, provide a regex, such as
            <code>*.example.com</code>.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>SSL Certificate</strong></td>
            <td>Specifies the CA certificate for TLS communication. If the server certificate is not
            signed by a known authority, for example, an internal syslog server,
            provide the CA certificate of the log management service endpoint.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

3. Click **Save**.

### <a id="parallel-upgrades"></a>Service Instance Upgrades

You can upgrade a configurable number of service instances concurrently by entering a new
value that is greater than `1` and less than the BOSH worker count
for the **Number of simultaneous upgrades**.

1. Specify a set of service instances to act as canaries for the
upgrade process by changing the **Number of upgrade canary instances**
to a value greater than `0`.
If all canary instances successfully upgrade,
the remaining instances are upgraded.
If any canary instance fails to upgrade, the upgrade fails
and no further instances are upgraded.

    ![Instance Upgrades section](./images/instance-upgrades-section.png)

2. Click **Save**.

### <a id="security"></a>Security

There are three configuration aspects to the Security settings.
Each of the three must be considered and appropriately handled
within these settings.
Once the Security properties settings have been set,
click **Save**.
The Security properties Settings page appears as:

![Security section](./images/security-settings.png)

The three items in this page to handle are:

1. The environment may be configured to more securely store service keys
within CredHub,
instead of within the cloud controller's data store.
To enable this functionality,
click on the box labeled **Enable Secure Service Instance Credentials**
to enable use of CredHub.
When service keys are stored within CredHub,
output from the `cf env APP-NAME` command will not show credentials.

2. An `X` is required in the text box to promote the understanding that
the environment must be set up to handle TLS encryption.
For information about preparing the <%=vars.app_runtime_abbr%> environment,
see [Preparing for Transport Layer Security (TLS)](prepare-TLS.html).

3. If User Account and Authentication (UAA) of <%=vars.product_short%> users will use
an external system,
enable this with the radio button labeled **UAA Auth enabled**.
With UAA enabled, create a UAA client before doing this tile installation
as explained in [Create a User Account and Authentication (UAA) Client](create-UAA-client.html).
Follow the instructions in
[Configuring User Account and Authentication (UAA) Roles](UAA-config.html) to complete the
configuration by setting up the user roles.
With UAA enabled, two text boxes will appear.
Fill the boxes with the UAA client name and that
client's secret, which were set when the client was created.

### <a id="errands"></a> Errands

By default, post-deploy and pre-delete errands always run. 
VMware recommends keeping these defaults.
However, if necessary, you can change these defaults as follows.

For general information about errands in <%=vars.app_runtime_abbr%>, see [Managing Errands in Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-10/install/managing_errands.html) in the VMware Tanzu Ops Manager documentation.

1. Click **Errands**.

2. Change the setting for the errands.

3. Click **Save**.
