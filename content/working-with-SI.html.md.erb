This document describes how to choose a service plan, create and delete 
VMware GemFire for Tanzu Application Service service instances, and bind an app.

You must install the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) to run the commands in this 
topic. For more information, see [Installing the cf CL](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/2.12/tas-for-vms/install-go-cli.html) in the VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs product documentation.
