This topic lists which service tiles offer on-demand
and pre-provisioned service plans for use with VMware GemFire for TAS.
These plans let developers provision service instances when they want.

These contrast with the older *pre-provisioned* service plans,
which require operators to provision the service instances during installation
and configuration through the service tile UI.

The following table lists which service tiles offer on-demand
and pre-provisioned service plans:

<table class="nice">
  <tr>
    <th width="20%">Service tile</th>
    <th width="20%">Standalone product related to the service</th>
    <th width="20%">Supports on-demand</th>
    <th width="40%">Supports pre-provisioned</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>RabbitMQ for VMware Tanzu [VMs]</td>
    <td>Pivotal RabbitMQ</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes. Only recommended for test environments.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Redis for VMware Tanzu</td>
    <td>Redis</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes (shared-VM plan). Recommended only for test environments.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>MySQL for VMware Tanzu</td>
    <td>MySQL </td>
    <td>Yes<br></td>
    <td>No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>VMware GemFire</td>
    <td>VMware GemFire</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>No</td>
  </tr>
</table>

For services that offer both on-demand and pre-provisioned plans, you can choose the
plan you want to use when configuring the tile.
