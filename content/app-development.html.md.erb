This section introduces design patterns for structuring app design for VMware GemFire for Tanzu Application Service.
It presents a minimal view of cluster data organization to help
with data architecture design.
A complete presentation of a cluster's capabilities is in the
[VMware GemFire Product Documentation](https://docs-staging.vmware.com/en/VMware-GemFire/index.html).

An app that interacts with a VMware GemFire for Tanzu Application Service service instance will
use the VMware GemFire cluster within that service instance.
Architecting the data storage for the app requires some familiarity
with how clusters work.
