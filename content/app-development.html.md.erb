An app that interacts with a <%=vars.product_full%> service instance will
use the <%=vars.component_product%> cluster within that service instance.
Architecting the data storage for the app requires some familiarity
with how clusters work.

This section introduces design patterns for structuring app design.
It presents a minimal view of cluster data organization to help
with data architecture design.
A complete presentation of a cluster's capabilities is in the
[VMware GemFire Documentation](<%=vars.serverman%>/about_gemfire.html).
