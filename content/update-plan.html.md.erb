This topic explains how to update VMware GemFire for TAS plans.

Follow the steps below to update plans in Ops Manager.

1. Click on the VMware GemFire for Tanzu Application Service tile.
1. Click on the plan you want to update under the **Information** section.
1. Edit the fields with the changes you want to make to the plan.
1. Click **Save** button on the bottom of the page.
1. Click on **Ops Manager** to navigate to the **Installation Dashboard**.
1. Click **Review Pending Changes**. For more information, see [Reviewing Your Pending Product Changes in Tanzu Operations Manager](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-GemFire/10.0/gf/tools_modules-gfsh-command-pages-rebalance.html) in the VMware Tanzu Operations Manager documentation.
1. Click **Apply Changes**.

Plan changes are not applied to existing services instances until you run the `upgrade-all-service-instances` BOSH errand. You must use the BOSH CLI to run this errand. Until you run this errand, developers cannot update service instances.

Changes to fields that can be overridden by optional parameters, for example  `num_servers` or `new_size_percentage`, change the default value of these instance properties, but do not affect existing service instances.

If you change the allowed limits of an optional parameter, for example the maximum number of servers per cluster, existing service instances in violation of the new limits are not modified.

When existing instances are upgraded, all plan changes are applied to them.
Upgrades and updates to service instances can cause a rolling restart
of cluster servers.
Be aware that the rebalancing of data to maintain redundancy
may impact the performance of the remainder of
the servers within the service instance.

<p class="note warning"><strong> WARNING:</strong> Data loss may result
from the restart of a cluster. See
<a href="./update-instance.html#cluster-restart">Restarting a Cluster</a>
for the conditions under which data loss occurs.</p>
