### <a id="known-issues-v2-0-0"></a>Known Issues

#### <a name="service-broker-error"></a>Service Broker Error

If you use custom JVM parameters in advanced Java 8 configurations that are not supported in Java 11, you may see a the following error during manual service instance upgrades or when running the "Upgrade All Service Instances for VMware GemFire for VMs" errand:

```
Service broker error: invalid previous JVM configuration options: [<list of JVM options>], please delete or replace them in the previous deployment
```
Record the <list of JVM options> to use when working around the issue.

**To work around this issue**:

1. In a terminal window, retrieve the manifest for the affected service instance by running the following command:

    ```
    bosh -d service-instance_$(cf service SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME --guid)   manifest > manifest.yml
    ```
    Where `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` is the name of the affected service instance.

1. Edit the manifest.yml file that you just created by removing or replacing with the JDK11 equivalent all of the options in the `<list of JVM options>` part of the error message. The same option might appear multiple times.

1. Redeploy the service instance with the modified manifest:

    ```
    bosh -d service-instance_$(cf service SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME --guid)  deploy manifest.yml
    ```
    Where `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` is the name of the affected service instance.

1. Perform the upgrade:

    ```
    cf update-service <service_instace_name> --upgrade
    ```
    Where `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` is the name of the affected service instance.

#### <a id='validation-errand'></a>Validation Errand Failure

If you are upgrading to GemFire for TAS v2.0, you should first use `gfsh` to destroy the Lucene indexes on persistent regions before restarting the cluster.

GemFire for TAS v2.0 does not enforce this requirement during the processing of `cf update-service <service_instace_name> --upgrade`, but it does include a validation errand that is executed before making the upgrade available to developers.

**Resolution**:

If this errand fails, the errand's output lists the Service instances that contain indexes that must be deleted before upgrade. Delete these indexes, then run the upgrade process again.
