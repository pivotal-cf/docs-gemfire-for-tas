This topic lists the steps required to prepare to install VMware GemFire for TAS.
Work through these items prior to VMware GemFire for Tanzu Application Service tile installation.

- The [Networking for On-Demand Services](on-demand-networking.html)
section describes networking requirements for GemFire for TAS.

- GemFire for TAS requires TLS encryption for using gfsh and Pulse.
Follow the instructions in [Preparing for TLS](prepare-TLS.html) to
set up TLS encryption.

- For systems that implement an
external authentication such as LDAP via User Account and Authentication (UAA),
follow the instructions within
[Create a UAA Client](create-UAA-client.html).
There are also additional configuration steps to set up the SSO system,
as given within [Configuring UAA Roles](UAA-config.html).
