- The [Networking for On-Demand Services](on-demand-networking.html)
section describes networking requirements for PCC.

- PCC requires TLS encryption for using gfsh and Pulse.
Follow the instructions in [Preparing for TLS](prepare-TLS.html) to
set up TLS encryption.

- For systems that implement an authentication and enterprise SSO system
such as LDAP, follow the instructions within
[Create a UAA Client](create-UAA-client.html).
There are also additional configuration steps to set up the SSO system,
as given within [Configuring UAA Roles](UAA-config.html).
