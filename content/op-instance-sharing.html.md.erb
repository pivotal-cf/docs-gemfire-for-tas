This topic explains how to enable VMware GemFire for TAS service instance sharing.

The <%=vars.product_full%> implementation of instance sharing permits
read-only access to a <%=vars.product_short%> service instance within one space
by an app within another space.
A Cloud Foundry `admin` operator,
or one with administrative privileges,
may enable service-instance sharing for <%=vars.product_short%> service instances.

Enable service-instance sharing across a foundation with:

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf enable-feature-flag service_instance_sharing
</pre>

You must configure <%=vars.product_short%> service-instance sharing
as detailed in [Service-Instance Sharing](dev-instance-sharing.html).
