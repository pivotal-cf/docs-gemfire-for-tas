<a id="events"></a>

The GemFire cluster within a PCC service instance can handle events.
An app registers interest in a particular event,
and when the server detects the event,
an app-defined callback (also called a handler or a listener)
is invoked to handle the event.  

There are three aspects to configuring and implementing an event:

- the app defines or specifies the event
- the app registers the event with or identifies the event to
the system component that will detect the event
- the app defines the callback, which handles the event

## <a id="continuous-queries"></a> Continuous Queries

Continuous queries use a GemFire OQL query on region data to define an event.
A change in query results is the event.
The app registers both the query and the callback
to set up a continuous query.
Each region operation invokes the query, leading to the naming
of this type of event handling as continuous.

See [Querying with OQL](http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/geode/developing/querying_basics/query_basics.html) for details on the Object Query Language (OQL)
and generating queries.
