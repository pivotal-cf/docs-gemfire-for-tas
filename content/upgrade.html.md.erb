This topic describes upgrading VMware GemFire for Tanzu Application Service (TAS).

You can upgrade directly to VMware GemFire for Tanzu Application Service version <%=vars.product_version%> from the latest patch release of versions GemFire for TAS 1.10 or later.
This "jump upgrade" is a two-step process:

1. [Verify Current Version is Updated](#upgrade-verify-current-version)
2. [Upgrade](#upgrade)

## <a id=upgrade-verify-current-version></a> Verify Current Version is Updated

Verify that your current version of GemFire for TAS has been updated to its latest patch
release. Install the latest patch if necessary.

| GemFire for TAS Version (Major.Minor)         | Latest Patch Release |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| 1.14                                          | 1.14.8               |
| 1.13                                          | 1.13.7               |
| 1.12                                          | 1.12.4               |
| 1.11                                          | 1.11.3               |
| 1.10                                          | 1.10.9               |


Upgrading to GemFire for TAS 1.14 from any version other than those shown in the table above
requires multiple steps. For example, if your current version is v1.10.5, you must first upgrade to 
the latest patch of 1.10 shown in the table before you can jump upgrade to v2.0.

Additional version-specific upgrade considerations:

- Each GemFire for TAS release is compatible with two VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs) and Ops Manager versions. Incorporate those upgrades to TAS for VMs and Ops Manager in your upgrade process as required to maintain compatibility.

- If your application connects through the Services Gateway feature (introduced in v1.13.0), you must first upgrade to the latest GemFire for TAS v1.13 patch before upgrading further.

- To upgrade to v1.9 from an earlier release, you must upgrade minor releases in sequential order. For example, you must upgrade v1.7 to v1.8 before upgrading to v1.9.

- GemFire for TAS version 1.13.1 included an Apache Geode v1.13.2 performance improvement that increased the defaults for maximum number of pooled message processor threads and maximum partitioned region message processor threads.

    If you are upgrading from a version of GemFire for TAS earlier than version 1.13.1, and your
    system had been reaching the older, lower default maximums, then upgrading to v2.0 may result
    in increased use of system resources because the system is no longer constrained to the older
    values. If your system depends on constraining system resources to the older default values,
    set these properties explicitly using `DistributionManager.MAX_THREADS` and
    `DistributionManager.MAX_PR_THREADS`.

    The following table shows the older and new maximum values.

    | System Resource | Older Default Value | New Default Value |
    |-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
    | DistributionManager.MAX_THREADS    | 100        | 1000 |
    | DistributionManager.MAX_PR_THREADS | The greater of (CPUs * 4) or 16 | The greater of (CPUs * 32) or 200 |

## <a id=upgrade></a> Upgrade

Follow these steps to upgrade GemFire for TAS:

1. Download the new version of the tile from <%=vars.pivnet%>.
1. Upload the product to Ops Manager.
1. Click **Add** next to the uploaded product.
1. Click on the GemFire for TAS tile and configure the upgrade options.
    - To try the upgrade on a small number of service instances first, set the quantity of canary service instances as described in [Service Instance Upgrades](install-configure.html#parallel-upgrades). 
    - Set the number of instances that are to be upgraded in parallel as described in [Service Instance Upgrades](install-configure.html#parallel-upgrades).
    - Under the **Errands** section, choose the **Default (On)** value
    for the **Upgrade All Service Instances** post-deploy errand.
    **Save** the change.

1.  Click **Review Pending Changes**. For more information, see [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/install/review-pending-changes.html) in the Ops Manager product documentation.
1.  Click **Apply Changes**.

## <a id='enable-individual-upgrades'></a>Enable Individual Service Instance Upgrades

The default upgrade path upgrades all service instances as a result of
a tile upgrade.
This operation can take a lengthy amount of time.
To expedite upgrades,
an operator can permit developers to upgrade their own service instances
once the tile has been upgraded.

An operator enables individual service instance upgrades during 
tile installation.
This feature requires TAS for VMs/Ops Manager 2.7 or a higher version
and works for upgrading from GemFire for TAS 1.9.0 to a higher version.

Within the GemFire for TAS tile,
in the **Errands** section,
the default for the
**Upgrade All Service Instances** errand,
which upgrades all service instances, appears as:

![Individual Service Instance Upgrades Deactivated](./images/indiv-upgrades-deactivated.png)

To change the state of this errand such that individual
service instance upgrades are enabled,
choose **Off** for this errand:

![Individual Service Instance Upgrades Enabled](./images/indiv-upgrades-activated.png)

Click **Save**.

Once individual service instance upgrades are enabled,
the developer upgrades an individual service instance following
the instructions in [Upgrade a Single Service Instance](dev-upgrade.html).

## <a id='validation-errand'></a>Validation Errand

If you are upgrading to GemFire for TAS v2.0, you should first use `gfsh` to destroy the Lucene indexes on persistent regions before restarting the cluster.

GemFire for TAS v2.0 does not enforce this requirement during the processing of `cf update-service <service_instace_name> --upgrade`, but it does include a validation errand that is executed before making the upgrade available to developers.

If this errand fails, the errand's output lists the Service instances that contain indexes that must be deleted before upgrade.
