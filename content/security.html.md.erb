This topic describes security when using VMware GemFire for TAS.

The security measures implemented for a VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs)
foundation and
for VMware GemFire for Tanzu Application Service service instances within that foundation attempt to
reduce harm from agents with foundation access.
For general information about security in TAS for VMs, see [TAS for VMs Security](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/5.0/tas-for-vms/security.html) in the VMware Tanzu Application Service documentation.

Transport-Layer Security (TLS) encryption prevents easy access to communication between
components,
and role-based authentication and authorization limits access
to data.

### TLS Encryption for the GemFire for TAS Service Instance

Without TLS encryption with and within the GemFire for TAS service instance,
the diagram below identifies via green dotted-and-dashed lines the unencrypted, plaintext communication that a bad agent with TAS for VMs foundation access could listen to without TLS encryption.

Each of these unencrypted communication paths may be TLS-encrypted.
Enabling TLS encryption implements a one-way authentication of
apps, verifying the identity of cluster members.


You must also secure gfsh communication. Follow directions in
[Connect with gfsh over HTTPS](accessing-instance.html#gfsh-connect-https).

### Networking

To allow app access to the PCC network, create application security groups.
Allow access on the following ports:

* 1099
* 8080
* 40404
* 55221

For more information, see [Restricting App Access to Internal TAS for VMs Components](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/5.0/tas-for-vms/app-sec-groups.html) in the VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs documentation.

GemFire for TAS works with the IPsec Add-on for TAS for VMs. For more information, see [IPsec for VMware Tanzu](https://docs.vmware.com/en/IPsec-for-VMware-Tanzu/1.9/documentation/GUID-index.html).

### Security within the Cluster

The cluster within a GemFire for TAS service instance implements
role-based authentication
and authorizes cluster operations based upon the roles.

There are two sets of roles:

- One set has four roles for users that integrate
an external authentication such as LDAP
via User Account and Authentication (UAA).
See [Configuring UAA Roles](UAA-config.html) for a description of
the roles and the configuration that completes the integration.

- The other set of roles defaults when there is no
external authentication
integrated during the GemFire for TAS tile installation.
The identifiers assigned for these roles are detailed in
[Create Service Keys](accessing-instance.html#create-service-key).
GemFire for TAS service instances are created with three default user roles for
interacting with clusters:

    - **Cluster operator:** manages the VMware GemFire cluster and can access
    region data. Has the permissions `CLUSTER:MANAGE`, `CLUSTER:WRITE`, `CLUSTER:READ`, `DATA:MANAGE`, `DATA:WRITE`, and `DATA:READ`.
    - **Developer:** can access region data. Has the permissions `CLUSTER:READ`, `DATA:WRITE`, and `DATA:READ`.
    - **Gateway sender:** propagates region data to another GemFire for TAS service instance. Has the permission `DATA:WRITE`.

Which set is used for a GemFire for TAS service instance depends on the
options chosen during GemFire for TAS tile installation.

All gfsh and JMX clients must authenticate as
one of these user roles to access the cluster.
To authorize operations,
each user role is given predefined permissions for cluster operations.
To accomplish a cluster operation,
the user authenticates using one of the roles.
Prior to initiating the requested operation,
there is a verification that the
authenticated user role has permission to do the operation.
For more information about these permissions, see [Implementing Authorization](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-GemFire/10.0/gf/managing-security-implementing_authorization.html) in the VMware GemFire documentation.
