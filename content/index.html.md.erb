<%=vars.product_full%> is a high-performance, high-availability caching layer for <%=vars.app_runtime_full%> (<%=vars.app_runtime_abbr%>).
<%=vars.product_short%> offers an in-memory key-value store. It delivers low-latency responses to a large number of concurrent data-access requests.

<%=vars.product_short%> provides a service broker to create in-memory data clusters on demand.
These clusters are dedicated to the <%=vars.app_runtime_abbr%> space and tuned for specific use cases defined by your service plan.
Service operators can create multiple plans to support different use cases.

<%=vars.product_full%> uses <%=vars.component_product%> <%=vars.product_version_gemfire%>. The [<%=vars.component_product%> API Documentation](http://gemfire-apis.docs.pivotal.io/) details the API for client access to data objects within <%=vars.component_product%>.
<%=vars.product_short%> supports writing JavaScript apps with the [Node.js Client for VMware Tanzu™ GemFire®](https://gemfire-nodeclient.docs.pivotal.io).
