VMware GemFire for Tanzu Application Service is a high-performance, high-availability caching layer for VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs).
GemFire for TAS offers an in-memory key-value store. It delivers low-latency responses to a large number of concurrent data-access requests.

GemFire for TAS provides a service broker to create in-memory data clusters on demand.
These clusters are dedicated to the TAS for VMs space and tuned for specific use cases defined by your service plan.
Service operators can create multiple plans to support different use cases.

GemFire for TAS uses VMware GemFire.
