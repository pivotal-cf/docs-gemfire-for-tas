<%=vars.product_full%> is a high-performance, high-availability caching layer for <%=vars.app_runtime_full%> (<%=vars.app_runtime_abbr%>).
<%=vars.product_short%> offers an in-memory key-value store. It delivers low-latency responses to a large number of concurrent data-access requests.

<%=vars.product_short%> provides a service broker to create in-memory data clusters on demand.
These clusters are dedicated to the <%=vars.app_runtime_abbr%> space and tuned for specific use cases defined by your service plan.
Service operators can create multiple plans to support different use cases.

<%=vars.product_short%> uses <%=vars.component_product%>.
See [VMware GemFire Java API Reference](https://developer.vmware.com/apis/1657/)
for links to the API for client access to data objects
within <%=vars.component_product%>.
<%=vars.product_short%> supports writing JavaScript apps with the
[Node.js Client for VMware GemFireÂ®](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Node.js-Client-for-VMware-GemFire/2.0/gf-nodeclient/about-client-users-guide.html)
