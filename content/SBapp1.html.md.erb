This topic presents an example Spring Boot app to use with VMware GemFire for TAS.

<a id="sample-SB1"></a>

The versioned example Spring Boot Data GemFire app at
[PCC-Sample-App-PizzaStore](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/PCC-Sample-App-PizzaStore)
uses the VMware GemFire for Tanzu Application Service service instance as a system of record.
Directions for running the app are in the GitHub repository's `README.md` file.
The app is versioned, and branches of the repository represent GemFire for TAS
versions.
For GemFire for TAS <%=vars.product_version%>, use the branch named
`release/<%=vars.product_version_period%>`.

The app uses Spring Boot Data GemFire. The documentation for this opinionated extension of Spring Data GemFire is at [Spring Boot for Apache Geode & Pivotal GemFire Reference Guide](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot-data-geode-build/1.2.x/reference/html5/).

The app saves pizza orders within the VMware GemFire servers of a GemFire for TAS service
instance.
A REST interface provides a way for the app to take orders for
pizza toppings and sauces.

The app demonstrates how to set up and run the app based on
[The App's Location](architecture.html#AppLocation).

## Top Down Explanation

In this opinionated version of Spring Boot Data GemFire,
at the topmost level of the app,
the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation causes
the app to have a `ClientCache` instance.
Within the example app's `CloudcachePizzaStoreApplication` class,
place the annotation at the class definition level:

```
@SpringBootApplication
public class CloudcachePizzaStoreApplication
```

This app is the client within a standard client/server architecture.
The GemFire for TAS service instance contains the servers.
The client cache is a driver for interactions with the servers.

The Spring repository construct is the preferred choice to use
for the data storage, which will be an VMware GemFire region.
To implement it,
annotate this example's `PizzaRepository` implementation
with `@Repository`:

```
@Repository
public interface PizzaRepository extends CrudRepository<Pizza, String>
```

An VMware GemFire region underlies the Spring repository,
storing the ordered pizzas.
Annotate the `Pizza` class model with `@Region`:

```
@Region("Pizza")
public class Pizza {
```

Within the `Pizza` class, identify the key of the VMware GemFire region entries with
the `@Id` annotation.
It is the `name` field in this example:

```
@Getter @Id @NonNull
private final String name;
```

The `@SpringBootApplication` annotation
results in a chain of opinionated defaults,
all of which are appropriate for this app.
It identifies the app as a client.
The client receives an VMware GemFire client cache.
Any regions will default to type `PROXY`.
A proxy type of region forwards all region operations to the
GemFire servers; no data is stored within the app's client cache.

See [Configuring Regions](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data-gemfire/docs/current/reference/html/#bootstrap-annotation-config-regions) for Spring details.
See [Region Design](region-design.html) for GemFire for TAS details about regions.

## The App Controller

The `AppController` class implements the REST interface,
by annotating the class with `@RestController`:

```
@RestController
public class AppController
```
As pizzas are ordered,
a `CrudRepository.save()` operation causes an
VMware GemFire `put` operation that updates the region on the VMware GemFire server.
