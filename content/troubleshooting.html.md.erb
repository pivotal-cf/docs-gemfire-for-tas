This topic describes issues and solutions related to using VMware GemFire for Tanzu Application Service.

## <a id='acquire-artifacts'></a> Acquire Artifacts for Troubleshooting

### <a id='gemfire-logs'></a> Gather Cluster Logs

Cluster statistics and log files may be obtained by using the
`gfsh export logs` command.
See [Export gfsh Logs](using-pcc.html#exporting_logs) for details.

### <a id='view-statistics'></a> View Statistics Files and Logs

You can visualize the performance of your cluster by downloading
the statistics files from your servers.
These files are located in the persistent store on each VM.
To copy these files to your workstation, run the command:

```
bosh2 -e BOSH-ENVIRONMENT -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME scp server/0:/var/vcap/store/gemfire-server/statistics.gfs /tmp
```

Alternatively, use `bosh ssh` to access GemFire for TAS service instance server VMs
and directly obtain the VMware GemFire logs that reside within the directory
`/var/vcap/sys/log/gemfire-server`.

See [Visual Statistics Display (VSD)](vsd/overview.html) for information about loading the statistics files into VSD.

### <a id='thread-dumps'></a> Acquire Thread Dumps

Thread dumps may be useful for debugging.
Take at least three thread dumps on each VM, separating them by about
one second.

1. To list your VMs, run:

    ```
    bosh -e ENV -d DEPLOYMENT vms
    ```

    [Acquire the Deployment Name](#get-deployment-name) instructs how to
    acquire the string to substitute for `DEPLOYMENT`.

1. Use the VM in a `bosh ssh` command to ssh in to the
GemFire for TAS VM where you want to produce the thread dumps.
GemFire for TAS VMs can be referenced using a 0-based index, for example server/0,
or locator/2:

    ```
    bosh -e ENV -d DEPLOYMENT ssh server/0
    ```

1. Get into the Bosh Process Manager (bpm) shell by running 

    ```
    sudo /var/vcap/packages/bpm/bin/bpm shell JOB-NAME
    ```
    where JOB-NAME is either `gemfire-server` or `gemfire-locator`,
    depending on which GemFire for TAS VM you are on.

1. Find the process ID (PID) that is running the VMware GemFire Java process
by running 

    ```
    ps -aux | grep java
    ```
    Typically, the PID is 1.

1. As you take multiple thread dumps,
redirect the output of each to a uniquely named file.
This example uses the file name `threaddump1.txt`:

    ```
    /var/vcap/packages/jdk8/bin/jcmd 1 Thread.print > /tmp/threaddump1.txt
    ```
    Files in `/tmp` will be accessible on the VM in
    directory 
    `/var/vcap/data/gemfire-server/tmp` or `/var/vcap/data/gemfire-locator/tmp`.

1. Move the files to the `/tmp` directory on the VM by running 

    ```
    mv /var/vcap/data/gemfire-server/tmp/threaddump1.txt /tmp/
    ```

    or

    ```
    mv /var/vcap/data/gemfire-locator/tmp/threaddump1.txt /tmp/
    ```

1. Files can be copied to your local machine using `bosh scp` command.
From your local machine, run:

    ```
    bosh -d DEPLOYMENT scp VM:/tmp/threaddump1.txt .
    ```

    For example:

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ bosh -d service-instance_1fd2850e-b754-4c5e-aa5c-ddb54ee301e6 scp server/0:/tmp/threaddump1.txt .
    </pre>

### <a id='get-deployment-name'></a> Acquire the Deployment Name

The `DEPLOYMENT` name is needed in several troubleshooting procedures.
To acquire the `DEPLOYMENT` name:

1. Use the Cloud Foundry CLI. Target the space where the
service instance runs.

1. Discover the globally unique identifier (GUID) for the service instance:

    ```
    cf service INSTANCE-NAME --guid
    ```

    The output is the GUID. For example:

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ cf service dev-instance --guid
    1fd2850e-b754-4c5e-aa5c-ddb54ee301e6
    </pre>

1. Prefix the GUID with the string `service-instance_` to obtain
the `DEPLOYMENT` name.
For the example GUID, the `DEPLOYMENT` name is
`service-instance_1fd2850e-b754-4c5e-aa5c-ddb54ee301e6`.

## <a id='operator-troubleshooting'></a> Troubleshooting for Operators

### <a id='smoke-test-failures'></a> Smoke Test Failures

- **Error message:** "Creating p-cloudcache SERVICE-NAME failed"
    
    **Cause of the Problem:** The smoke tests could not create an instance
    of GemFire.

    **Action:** To troubleshoot why the deployment failed, 
    use the CF CLI to create a new service instance using the same plan 
    and download the logs of the service deployment from BOSH.

- **Error message:** "Deleting SERVICE-NAME failed"

    **Cause of the Problem:** The smoke test attempted to clean up a service instance it created 
    and failed to delete the service using the `cf delete-service` command.

    **Action:** Run BOSH `logs` to view the logs on the broker or the
    service instance to see why the deletion may have failed.

- **Error message:** "Cannot connect to the cluster SERVICE-NAME"

    **Cause of the Problem:** The smoke test was unable to connect
    to the cluster.

    **Action:** Review the logs of your load balancer,
    and review the logs of your CF Router to ensure the route to your GemFire for TAS
    cluster is properly registered.

    You also can create a service instance and try to connect to it using the
    gfsh CLI. This requires creating a service key.

- **Error message:** "Could not perform create/put on locator LOCATOR-ADDRESS"

    **Cause of the Problem:** `LOCATOR-ADDRESS` is the BOSH DNS name of
    the locator. The smoke test was unable to write data to the cluster.
    The user may not have permissions to create a region or write data.

### <a id='general-connectivity'></a> General Connectivity

- **Problem:**  Client-to-server communication

    **Cause of the Problem:** GemFire for TAS clients communicate to GemFire for TAS servers
    on port 40404 and with locators on port 55221.
    Both of these ports must be reachable from the VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs network to service
    the network.

- **Problem:**  Membership port range

    **Cause of the Problem:** GemFire for TAS servers and locators communicate with
    each other using UDP and TCP.
    The current port range for this communication is `49152-65535`.

    **Solution:** If you have a firewall between VMs,
    ensure this port range is open.

- **Problem:**  Port range usage across a WAN

    **Cause of the Problem:** Gateway receivers and gateway senders
    communicate across WAN-separated service instances.
    Each GemFire for TAS service instance uses VMware GemFire defaults for the
    gateway receiver ports.
    The default is the inclusive range of port numbers 5000 to 5499.

    **Solution:** Ensure this port range is open when WAN-separated
    service instances will communicate.

## <a id='developer-troubleshooting'></a> Troubleshooting for Developers

- **Problem:**  An error occurs when creating a service instance or
when running a smoke test.
The service creation issues an error message that starts with

    ```
    Instance provisioning failed: There was a problem completing your request.
    ```

    VMware GemFire server logs at
    `/var/vcap/sys/log/gemfire-server/gemfire/server-<N>.log`
    will contain a disk-access error with the string

    ``` 
    A DiskAccessException has occurred
    ``` 

    and a stack trace similar to this one that begins with

    ``` 
    org.apache.geode.cache.persistence.ConflictingPersistentDataException
        at org.apache.geode.internal.cache.persistence.PersistenceAdvisorImpl.checkMyStateOnMembers(PersistenceAdvisorImpl.java:743)
        at org.apache.geode.internal.cache.persistence.PersistenceAdvisorImpl.getInitialImageAdvice(PersistenceAdvisorImpl.java:819)
        at org.apache.geode.internal.cache.persistence.CreatePersistentRegionProcessor.getInitialImageAdvice(CreatePersistentRegionProcessor.java:52)
        at org.apache.geode.internal.cache.DistributedRegion.getInitialImageAndRecovery(DistributedRegion.java:1178)
        at org.apache.geode.internal.cache.DistributedRegion.initialize(DistributedRegion.java:1059)
        at org.apache.geode.internal.cache.GemFireCacheImpl.createVMRegion(GemFireCacheImpl.java:3089)
    ``` 

    **Cause of the Problem:** The GemFire for TAS VMs are underprovisioned;
    the quantity of disk space is too small.

    **Solution:** Use Ops Manager to provision VMs of at least
    the minimum size.
    See [Configure Service Plans](install-configure.html#plan-config)
    for minimum-size details.
