This topic explains backing up and restoring service instances for use with VMware GemFire for TAS.

<a id="BandR"></a>

Both disaster recovery and system validation depend upon
backups.
A VMware GemFire for Tanzu Application Service service instance backup consists of the configuration for a
GemFire for TAS service instance together with all region data that has been
persisted to disk.
A GemFire for TAS service instance backup may be used to restore the service
on a new, but unconfigured GemFire for TAS service instance.

# Before You Begin

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: Consider each of these
important items when preparing to back up and restore a GemFire for TAS service instance.
Since recovery depends on a correct implementation,
address each item during planning.</p>

- The backup consists of data from regions that have
been persisted to disk.
All non-persistent region data will be lost.
A persistent region is one that writes its region entries to disk.
- The backup and restoration process does not restore WAN replication
configuration. A GemFire for TAS service instance that replicates data via WAN
may be backed up. A restore of that GemFire for TAS service instance will
contain all the persistent data. That GemFire for TAS service instance will
be able to communicate with other WAN-connected service instances after further configuration.
- The disk size on the jumpbox VM must be large enough to hold the
backup artifacts. The quantity of disk space needs to exceed
the sum total of all disk space used within the GemFire for TAS service instance to be
backed up.
An approximation of that quantity of disk space may be calculated
by looking at the fully populated GemFire for TAS service instance.
Sum the disk space (in `/var/vcap/store`) used by each locator and server.
- The GemFire for TAS service instance needs to be quiescent when the backup is
taken. An active cluster could have disk writes in progress,
leading to a backup for which region data may or may not have been
written to disk.
- The fresh GemFire for TAS service instance that is to be used for a restore
must have same quantity of locators and servers as the
GemFire for TAS service instance had when its backup was taken.
The fresh GemFire for TAS service instance must have sufficient resources
to hold the data that is in the backup.
- Do not configure the fresh GemFire for TAS service instance
that is to be used for a restore after creation.
It must be empty. Do not create any regions or start any gateway senders.
The restore will create all regions, both persistent and not persistent.
The non-persistent regions will be empty.
- Service keys are not part of the backup. New service keys must be created on a restored service instance.

# Backing Up a GemFire for TAS Service Instance

1. Optional: Back up the VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs environment.
For instructions, see [Backing Up and Restoring your Tanzu Operations Manager Deployment](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/install-backup-restore-index.html) in the VMware Tanzu Ops Manager documentation.

2. Optional: Compact the disk stores of the cluster to be backed up.
Use the gfsh `compact disk-store` command after connecting to the cluster
with a role that is authorized with the `CLUSTER:MANAGE` operation permission.
See the `gfsh` [compact disk-store](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-GemFire/10.0/gf/tools_modules-gfsh-command-pages-compact.html) command in the VMware GemFire documentaion.

3. Optional: Acquire a region statistic that may be used for a minimal
validation upon using this backup for subsequent restoration.
Use the gfsh `describe region` command on each persistent region,
after connecting to the cluster
with a role that is authorized with the `CLUSTER:READ` operation permission.

    ```
    describe region --name=REGION-NAME
    ```
    For each persistent region (the `data-policy` will contain the string
    `PERSISTENT`), record the `size` of region. This size is the quantity
    of entries in the region. Assuming that activity on
    the region is quiescent, when this backup is used in a restoration,
    the quantity of region entries in the restored region forms a
    minimal validation of the region.

4. SSH to the jumpbox.
Assuming that the Ops Manager VM is being used as the jumpbox,
follow directions in
[Log in to the Tanzu Operations Manager VM with SSH](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/install-trouble-advanced.html#log-in-to-the-tanzu-operations-manager-vm-with-ssh-1) in _Advanced Tanzu Operations Manager Troubleshooting with BOSH CLI_ in the VMware Tanzu Operations Manager documentation.

5. Determine all needed credentials and parameters for the
command that makes the backup:
    - `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP`: Obtain the BOSH Director IP address by following the instructions in [Retrieve BOSH Director Address](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/install-backup-restore-backup-pcf-bbr.html#step-4-retrieve-bosh-director-address-13) in _Backing Up You Tanzu Operations Manager Deployments with BBR_ in the VMware Tanzu Operations Manager documentation.
    -  `SERVICE-INSTANCE-DEPLOYMENT-NAME`: Obtain the deployment name by following the instructions at [Acquire the Deployment Name](troubleshooting.html#get-deployment-name).
    -  `BOSH-CLIENT`, `BOSH-CLIENT-PASSWORD`, and `PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE`: To learn all three of these values, open the Credentials tab of the BOSH Director tile in Ops Manager. Find and open `Bosh Commandline Credentials`.
The path is the path to the root Certificate Authority (CA) certificate,
and its value will be `/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate` if Ops Manager and the jumpbox are on the same VM.

6. Make the backup. From the jumpbox, issue this command,
substituting values acquired in the previous step:

    ```
    BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=BOSH-CLIENT-PASSWORD \
    bbr deployment \
    --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --username BOSH-CLIENT \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
    --deployment SERVICE-INSTANCE-DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    backup
    ```

    `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET` is an environment variable that is set only
    for the duration of the command.

    The backup will be within a directory on the jumpbox named by
    the deployment name and a timestamp.

7. Copy the backup to a permanent home for archiving.
VMware recommends compressing and encrypting the files.
Disaster recovery plans often recommend archiving multiple copies
of each backup.

# Restoring a GemFire for TAS Service Instance

1. Use SSH to connect to the jumpbox.
Assuming that the Ops Manager VM is being used as the jumpbox,
follow directions in
[Log in to the Tanzu Operations Manager VM with SSH](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/install-trouble-advanced.html#log-in-to-the-tanzu-operations-manager-vm-with-ssh-1) in _Advanced Tanzu Operations Manager Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI_ in the VMware Tanzu Operations Manager documentation.

2. Transfer the archived backup to the jumpbox.
Expand if compressed, and decrypt if encrypted.

3. Make a new, but empty service instance.
See directions in [Creating a VMware GemFire for Tanzu Application Service Service Instance](create-instance.html).
If the service instance to be restored was connected to a WAN, be sure to create the new instance with the same `distributed_system_id` as
the old one.

4. Determine all needed credentials and parameters for the
command that does the restore by following step 5 instructions
from making the backup.

5. Do the restore. From the jumpbox, issue this command,
substituting values acquired in the previous step:

    ```
    $ BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=BOSH-CLIENT-PASSWORD \
    bbr deployment \
    --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --username BOSH-CLIENT \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
    --deployment SERVICE-INSTANCE-DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    restore --artifact-path PATH-TO-SERVICE-INSTANCE-ARTIFACT
    ```

    `PATH-TO-SERVICE-INSTANCE-ARTIFACT` is the path to the artifact for the instance that you are currently restoring.

6. Create a new service key, as the service key was not an artifact
that the backup created.
For a stand-alone service instance (one that is not part of a WAN), follow the directions at [Create a Service Key](accessing-instance.html#create-service-key).
For a WAN-connected service instance, see [Restoring a WAN Connection](WAN-bi-reconnect.html).

7. If the region size was captured prior to making the
backup, in order to do a minimal validation
of the restored cluster,
use the gfsh `describe region` command on each persistent region,
after connecting to the cluster
with a role that is authorized with the `CLUSTER:READ` operation permission.

    ```
    describe region --name=REGION-NAME
    ```
    For each persistent region, the `size` of the restored region should be
    the same as the value captured when the backup was made.

8. Rebind or restage all apps.
