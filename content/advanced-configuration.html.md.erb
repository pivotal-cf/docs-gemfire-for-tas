This topic explains the advanced configuration settings when creating a service instance of VMware GemFire for TAS.

**Warning:** This is an advanced feature and can have a significant impact on the stability of the
GemFire cluster and the underlying JVM. Users should advance with caution unless they are an
advanced user or are being instructed by support staff.

The advanced configuration feature allows users to configure custom JVM options, GemFire properties,
Credentials, and Resource Manager properties. While the majority of parameters have the ability to
be changed, there is a small group that cannot be changed due to their impact on the TAS platform.

Warning: Do not modify the security properties listed below using advanced configuration.

Some security properties set using advanced configuration are overwritten by the default settings, and modifying the security properties can lead to unintended consequences. For example, when SSL endpoint verification is enabled, the configuration for protocols and ciphers reverts to the SSLContext's client mode defaults. If advanced configuration was used to modify the security properties, increased difficulty when upgrading the JDK can occur when the newer JDK uses different defaults for client and server mode SSL. Additionally, modifying the security properties can lead to duplicate properties being set.

Do not modify the following security properties:

* security-gateway-password
* security-gateway-username
* security-json
* security-password
* security-username
* ssl-enabled-components
* ssl-endpoint-identification-enabled
* ssl-keystore
* ssl-keystore-password
* ssl-require-authentication
* ssl-truststore
* ssl-truststore-password
* ssl-web-require-authentication

---

The following JVM options are unavailable for customization:

```
-Xms
-Xmx
-Xloggc
-XX:NumberOfGCLogFiles
-XX:GCLogFileSize
-XX:OnOutOfMemoryError
-XX:+DisableExplicitGC
```

The following GemFire property is unavailable for customization:

```
-Dgemfire.OSProcess.ENABLE_OUTPUT_REDIRECTION
```

Furthermore, if one of the following properties below is set, then VMware GemFire for TAS will NOT
set default values for any of the other properties listed below. The responsibility lies on the user
to determine and set all of the values.
 
```
-XX:NewSize
-XX:MaxNewSize
-XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction
-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions
-XX:ParGCCardsPerStrideChunk=32768
-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC
-XX:+UseCMSInitiatingOccupancyOnly
-XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled
```

## Setting Advanced Configurations

Users can set an advanced_configuration when creating a service instance such as:

```
cf create-service p-cloudcache dev-plan qa_instance -c 
'{
   "advanced_configuration":{
      "server":{

         "jvm_options":["-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions",   
             "-XX:ParGCCardsPerStrideChunk=1274"],

         "gemfire_properties":{"enable-cluster-configuration":"true"},

         "credentials": {
           "db_user_credhub_key": "credhub/ref/myuser",
           "db_password_credhub_key": "credhub/ref/mypassword"
         },

	    "resource_manager": {
            "critical_heap_percentage": 80,
            "eviction_heap_percentage": 60
          }
      },

      "locator":{

         "jvm_options":["-XX:+UseNUMA"],

         "gemfire_properties":{"groups":"QA_DB_1"},

         "credentials": {
           "db_user_credhub_key": "credhub/ref/myuser",
           "db_password_credhub_key": "credhub/ref/mypassword"
         },

	    "resource_manager": {
            "critical_heap_percentage": 80,
            "eviction_heap_percentage": 60,
    }
      }
   }
}'
```

The advanced_configuration allows users to set options for the servers and the locators.  Within
each (server and locator) users can set jvm_options, gemfire_properties, credentials, and resource
managers.

## Updating a Service Instance with Advanced Configuration

To update a service instance with advanced configurations, run the `cf update-service` command with
the configuration that you would like to apply to the service instance.

**Warning**

This new configuration WILL OVERWRITE any previous advanced configuration that may have been set on the service instance.
Any configuration option not set in the advanced_configuration update to the service instance will revert back to the default value. 

```
cf update-service qa_instance -c 
'{
   "advanced_configuration":{
      "server":{
         "jvm_options":["-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions",   
             "-XX:ParGCCardsPerStrideChunk=1274"],
         "gemfire_properties":{"enable-cluster-configuration":"true"},
         "credentials": {
           "db_user_credhub_key": "credhub/ref/myuser",
           "db_password_credhub_key": "credhub/ref/mypassword"
         },
	    "resource_manager": {
            "critical_heap_percentage": 80,
            "eviction_heap_percentage": 60
          }

      },
      "locator":{
         "jvm_options":["-XX:+UseNUMA"],
         "gemfire_properties":{"groups":"QA_DB_1"},
         "credentials": {
           "db_user_credhub_key": "credhub/ref/myuser",
           "db_password_credhub_key": "credhub/ref/mypassword"
         },
         "resource_manager": {
            "critical_heap_percentage": 80,
            "eviction_heap_percentage": 60
          }
      }
   }
}'
```

## Reset Advanced Configuration to Default Values

To reset all advanced settings to their default values, run the `cf update-service` command and set the advanced_configuration settings to empty brackets {}.

```
cf update-service qa_instance -c 
'{
   "advanced_configuration":{}
}'
```
