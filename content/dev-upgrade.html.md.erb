This topic describes how developers can upgrade a VMware GemFire for TAS service instance.

If individual service instance upgrades are permitted by the operator,
and a newer tile has been made available,
then developers may upgrade their own service instances by following
the procedure here.
[Enable Individual Service Instance Upgrades](upgrade.html#enable-individual-upgrades)
describes how an operator enables developer upgrades of their
own service instances. 

The cf CLI, v6.46.0 or a more recent version, is a prerequisite
for upgrading a VMware GemFire for Tanzu Application Service service instance.

To upgrade a single GemFire for TAS service instance:

1. Confirm that an upgrade is available for the service instance;
the upgrade is available when the `upgrade available` column of the
output says `yes`, as in the sample output:

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf services
Getting services in org system / space system as admin...

name   service      plan            last operation   broker            upgrade available
testSI p-cloudcache small-footprint create succeeded cloudcache-broker yes

</pre>

2. Upgrade the service instance with a command of the form:

```
cf update-service SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME --upgrade
```

Replace `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` with the name of the instance to
be upgraded.
Confirm that you want to update when prompted.
