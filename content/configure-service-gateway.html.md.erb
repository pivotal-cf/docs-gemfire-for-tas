This topic describes how to configure a service gateway for use with VMware GemFire for TAS.

A service gateway enables communication from an app to the
GemFire for TAS service instance.
The running [App's Location](architecture.html#AppLocation) determines
whether a service gateway is required.

The operator needs to complete two items to enable a service gateway:

- With a VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs) version 2.10 deployment, follow the directions in [Enabling and Configuring TCP Routing in TAS for VMs](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/3.0/tas-for-vms/enabling-tcp-routing.html) in the VMware TAS for VMs documentation.
Note the range entered for the **TCP routing ports**.
One port from this range will be required to configure
the GemFire for TAS tile.

- Configure the GemFire for TAS tile to enable the service gateway
as described in _Settings: Enable Creation of a Service Gateway_ in [Installing and Configuring VMware GemFire](install-configure.html).
