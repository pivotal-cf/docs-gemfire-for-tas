This section describes networking considerations for VMware Tanzu GemFire for VMs.

<h2> <a id="service-network"></a>Service Network Requirement </h2>

When you deploy VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs), you must create a statically defined network to host
the component VMs that make up the  infrastructure.
Components, such as Cloud Controller and UAA, run on this infrastructure network.

On-demand services might require you to host them on a separate network
from the  default network.
You can also deploy on-demand services on a separate service networks to meet your own security requirements.

TAS for VMs supports dynamic networking.
Operators can use dynamic networking with asynchronous service provisioning to define
dynamically-provisioned service networks.
For more information, see <a href="#on-demand">Default Network and Service Network</a> below.

On-demand services are enabled by default on all networks.
Operators can optionally create separate networks to host services in BOSH Director.
Operators can select which network hosts on-demand service instances when they configure the tile for that service.

<h3> <a id ="architecture_networks"></a>Default Network and Service Network </h3>

On-demand GemFire services use BOSH to dynamically deploy VMs and create single-tenant
service instances in a dedicated network.
On-demand services use the dynamically-provisioned service network to host single-tenant worker VMs.
These worker VMs run as service instances within development spaces.

This on-demand architecture has the following advantages:
<ul>
  <li>Developers can provision IaaS resources for their services instances when the instances are created.
This removes the need for operators to pre-provision a fixed amount of IaaS resources
  when they deploy the service broker.</li>
  <li>Service instances run on a dedicated VM and do not share VMs with unrelated processes.
This removes the "noisy neighbor" problem, where an app monopolizes resources on a shared cluster.</li>
  <li>Single-tenant services can support regulatory compliances where
  sensitive data must be separated across different machines.</li>
</ul>

An on-demand service separates operations between the default network and the
service network. Shared service components, such as executive controllers and databases,
Cloud Controller, UAA, and other on-demand components, run on the default network.
Worker pools deployed to specific spaces run on the service network.

The diagram below shows worker VMs in an on-demand service instance
running on a separate services network, while other components run on the default
network.

<h3> <a id="network-rules"></a>Required Networking Rules for On-Demand Services </h3>

Before deploying a service tile that uses the on-demand service broker (ODB),
you must create networking rules to enable components
to communicate with ODB. For instructions for creating networking rules,
see the documentation for your IaaS.

The following table lists key components and their responsibilities in the on-demand
architecture.

<table class="nice">
  <th>Key Components</th>
  <th>Component Responsibilities</th>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>BOSH Director</strong></td>
    <td>Creates and updates service instances as instructed by ODB.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>BOSH Agent</strong></td>
    <td>Adds an agent on every VM that it deploys. The agent listens for instructions from the BOSH Director and executes those instructions. The agent receives job specifications from the BOSH Director and uses them to assign a role or job to the VM.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>BOSH UAA</strong></td>
    <td>Issues OAuth2 tokens for clients to use when they act on behalf of BOSH users.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong><%= vars.app_runtime_full %></strong></td>
    <td>Contains the apps that consume services.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>ODB</strong></td>
    <td>Instructs BOSH to create and update services. Connects to services to create bindings.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Deployed service instance</strong></td>
    <td>Runs the given service. For example, a deployed GemFire service instance runs the GemFire service.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Regardless of the specific network layout, the operator must ensure network
rules are set up so that connections are open as described in the table below.

<h2> <a id ="WAN_details"></a><%=vars.product_short%> Instances Across WAN </h2>

<%=vars.product_short%> service instances running within distinct <%=vars.app_runtime_full%> foundations
may communicate with each other across a WAN.
In a topology such as this,
the members within one service instance use their own private address space,
as defined in [RFC1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918).

A VPN may be used to connect the private network spaces that lay
across the WAN.
The steps required to enable the connectivity by VPN are dependent
on the IaaS providers.

The private address space for each service instance's network
must be configured with non-overlapping CIDR blocks.
Configure the network prior to creating service instances.
Locate directions for creating a network on the appropriate IAAS provider
in [Platform Architecture and Planning Overview](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-10/refarch/index.html) in the VMware Tanzu Ops Manager documentation.


Open port `1053` to allow DNS resolution of other WAN-connected clusters.
