This topic explains how to create a User Account and Authentication (UAA) account for use with VMware GemFire for TAS.

Extra configuration is required when defining users that have specific
security roles with an
external authentication such as LDAP through User Account and Authentication (UAA).

Authenticating using an
external authentication such as LDAP through UAA
uses the UAA server.
Access the UAA server through its command-line interface, UAAC.

When enabling the use of an
external authentication such as LDAP through UAA
during VMware GemFire for Tanzu Application Service tile configuration,
you will specify a UAA client,
as described in [Security](install-configure.html#security-section).
This procedure creates that UAA client.

Create a UAA client for use in tile configuration with the command:

```
uaac client add cloudcache_gfsh --scope="PCC_*" --secret="THE-SECRET"
   --authorized_grant_types=password
```
Replace `THE-SECRET` with your chosen password (secret) for this UAA client.
The remainder of the command is exactly as shown.
The UAA client name is `cloudcache_gfsh`.
