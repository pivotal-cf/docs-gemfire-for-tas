VSD works on Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms.

**64-Bit Platform Support**

VSD is a 32-bit application. If you are running VSD on a 64-bit operating system, you may need to install 32-bit OS libraries to run the application if they are not already installed. On Linux, to find out which libraries are missing you can try running the following:

``` pre
ldd PRODUCT-DIR/tools/vsd/bin/vsdwishLinux
```

For 64-bit Windows, you can modify the scripts and executables as described in the note below.

**Windows 7 and Later Support**

To use VSD on Windows 7, perform the following steps:

1.  Start Windows Explorer and navigate to the 
`PRODUCT-DIR\tools\vsd\bin\`
directory, where `PRODUCT-DIR` corresponds to the installation location.
2.  Right click and select properties for `vsd.bat`.
3.  Select the Compatibility tab.
4.  Click "Run this program in compatibility mode for" and then select Windows XP SP3.
5.  Repeat steps for all the other executables in the `bin` directory.
